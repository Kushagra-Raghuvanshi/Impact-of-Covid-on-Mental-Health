NOTE: All Datasets (Proccessed) are available available in repository and DONT HAVE TO BE
DOWNLOADED FROM THE URLs

• pulse survey dataset.csv

• Table-1.csv

• march.csv

• may.csv

• disorder analysis bystate.py

• disorder visualisation complete.py

• stress anxiety usa.py

• drug survey visualisation.py

• correlation and computations.py

• requirements.txt


2) Put all file in a SINGLE folder named as per you convenience

3) Open Pycharm after putting the folder inside another folder set up with pycharm already or instead open this
folder by making a new Pycharm project by setting this folder as source root directory

4) Install all Python libraries mentioned in requirements.txt

5) Run the python file main.py to observe all plots

NOTE 1: The user might have to upgrade pip to the latest version (greater than or equal to version 21.3.1) if any
error pops up.

NOTE 2: To ensure the plots are represented in the correct order run main.py by clicking on the green ar-
row Run ’main’ instead of right clicking and selecting Run File in Python Console

NOTE 3: Only one plot is shown at a time. To observe all plots the user is required to close each plot so the
next one pops up

NOTE 4: How to interpret the Correlation Graphs - Since we are taking ratio there is a differ-
ence between usual correlation graphs and Our version

Our Version:

Constant (parallel to x axis) ⇒ +ve Correlation

Graphing going up or down (By a small f actor) ⇒ still almost + ve Correlation

Graphing going up or down (By a major f actor) ⇒ −ve Correlation
